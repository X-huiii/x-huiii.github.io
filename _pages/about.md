Hi, everyone! I am currently a senior undergraduate student at [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn), Weihai, China, working under the supervision of [Prof. Sitian Qin](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/qin). My research lies at the intersection of queueing theory and optimization, with a primary focus on learning dynamics within AI-enabled service and decision systems. Specifically, I am interested in developing analytically grounded models for modern service operations. Starting in August 2026, I will join the [Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management (SEEM)](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong as a Ph.D. student.
