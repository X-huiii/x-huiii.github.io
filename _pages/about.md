<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>


I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Information and Computational Science at Harbin Institute of Technology (Weihai). My academic interests lie in optimization theory, learning dynamics, and AI-related modeling problems. I am particularly interested in mathematically grounded approaches to optimization and learning systems. I am preparing to begin my Ph.D. studies in the Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management (SEEM) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong in August 2026.
